* Implement all actuator register definitions
* Defin dxl_* functions in dxl.h
* Implement :
	dxl_open( portname, proto, baurate )
	dxl_close( portname )
	uint8* dxl_read( portname, proto, baurate, devidstart, devidnb, address, length )
	dxl_write( )
	
	
Simulink Bloc
=============

Input:
	One dimension value. Customizable through user interface.
Output:
	Up to five values. Customizable through user interface.
Start:
	Enable. Address customizable.
Stop:
	Disbale. Same address than start.

** UI **

Port name (0=/dev/ttyUSB0, ..., 9=/dev/ttyUSB0, 10=/dev/ttyS0, ...)
Baudrate
Protocol (1 or 2)
Start ID (Lowest ID to be addressed)
NB IDs (Number of devices that should be addressed, min 1)
Enable address (address of the enable register)
Write address (address of the register that should be written as input)
Write length (size of the written register, 1, 2 or 4)
Read address 1 (address of the first register to be read)
Read lenght 1 (length of the first register to be read)
...
Read address 5 (address of the fifth register to be read)
Read lenght 5 (length of the fifth register to be read)
